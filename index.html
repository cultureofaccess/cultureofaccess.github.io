	<h1>Culture of Access</h1>

	<h3>A newsletter about the sharing economy, minimalism and the environment</h3>

	<p>Hi, my name is Martin and I write a newsletter.</b>

	<p>It's about three things that I think are very important: the sharing economy, minimalism and environmentalism. An exciting trend in startups and entrepreneurship, a life philosophy which I think can make you happier and more free, and the most pressing issue affecting the long-term safety of humanity.</p>

	<p>The <b>sharing economy</b> lets you borrow the things you need, so you can live a more <b>minimalist life</b> by owning less, and by owning less you reduce your <b>environmental impact</b> by consuming less energy and fewer materials.</p>

	<p>I'd love it if you subscribed. I promise it will be worth your time - and if you don't like it then an unsubscribe is only a click away...</p>

	<p>But perhaps you don't know what those three things are. Well...</p>

 	<p>The sharing economy is the use of technology and 'the social web' to let enable peer-to-peer sharing and commerce. Renting out your house when it's empty, giving people lifts when you'd be driving in an empty car, that kind of thing.</p>

 	<p>Environmentalism probably takes even less explaining: we should probably be treating the natural world with some kind of respect. Duh.</p>

	<p>Minimalism is the one which I imagine fewer people are familiar with: it's the idea that our lives can be improved by owning less. The hope is that by having fewer things we spend less effort clearing, cleaning and maintaining our stuff and in exchange have more time and energy to focus on personal relationships, self-improvement and travel. There are plenty of people writing about this: I'd recommend The Minimalists even if they do get a bit preachy sometimes...</p>

 	<p>But what's the connection between the three?</p>

 	<p>I think the sharing economy has the opportunity to act as an enabler: it lets us make more efficient use of the things we own so that less is wasted, and it means we don't have to buy the things we seldom use but have 'just in case'. If you have fewer things you're more able to travel freely and the sharing economy lets you do that more cheaply and efficiently, and you can stay in houses which would otherwise be left empty. In short, the sharing economy lets you own less, and owning less reduces your impact on the environment.</p>
